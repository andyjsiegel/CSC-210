Placeholder text is commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development to show the visual form of a document or layout without using actual content.
The most well-known placeholder text is "Lorem ipsum", which has been used since the 1500s as a dummy text.
Placeholder text should have sufficient contrast to be accessible, according to WCAG guidelines.
Placeholder text can be added and edited in various software and platforms, such as Qualtrics, Confluence, and Dropbox. The process may vary depending on the specific tool.
