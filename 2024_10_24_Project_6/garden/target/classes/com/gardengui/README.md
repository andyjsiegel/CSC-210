# Fruit Class Implementation
The Fruit class is a subclass of the Plant superclass.

It has no special methods, just a constructor that invokes `super()` to pass the name to the Plant class. In this garden simulation, fruits grow from left to right. See the example below:
```
Stage 1:
.....
.....
a....
.....
.....
Stage 2:
.....
.....
aa...
.....
.....
Stage 3:
.....
.....
aaa..
.....
.....
Stage 4:
.....
.....
aaaa.
.....
.....
Stage 5:
.....
.....
aaaaa
.....
.....
```

Example In/Out:

Input:
```
rows: 5
cols: 1

PLANT (4,0) apple
grow 1
PLANT (3,0) apple
grow 1
PLANT (2,0) apple
grow 1
PLANT (1,0) apple
grow 1
PLANT (0,0) apple
print
```

Output:
```
> GROW 1

> GROW 1

> GROW 1

> GROW 1

> PRINT
